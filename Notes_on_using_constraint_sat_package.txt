Notes on using the constraint satisfaction package (constraint-0.4.0):

You'll need to install the package in your Python library. On a *nix operating system, this is done in the command line as follows:
# cd /your/path/here/Employee-Scheduler/logilab-common-0.57.2/
# sudo python setup.py build
# sudo python setup.py install
# cd ../constraint-0.4.0/
# sudo python setup.py build
# sudo python setup.py install

I *think* this is all you need. -- TAY
