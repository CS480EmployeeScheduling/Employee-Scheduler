This package implements constraint propagation algorithm to solve
constraint satisfaction problem. It requires python 2.3 or later to
work. Having psyco (http://psyco.sf.net) installed will definitely
speed up things, but is not a requirement.

It is released under the GNU Public License. 

The documentation is in the doc/ directory. Examples are in the
examples/ directory.

Discussion about constraint should take place on the python-logic
mailing list. Information on subscription and mailing list archives
can be accessed at
http://lists.logilab.org/mailman/listinfo/python-logic/

Your feedback is very valuable to me. Please share tour experience
with other users of the package on the mailing list.
