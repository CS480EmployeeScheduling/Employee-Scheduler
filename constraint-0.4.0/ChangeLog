ChangeLog for logilab.constraint
================================

2008-08-07  --  0.4.0
    * allow capture of solver output



2005-09-05  --  0.3.0
    * Added finite interval domains and constraints in module
      constraint.fi

    * constraint now depends on logilab.common to support a larger number
      of python versions 

    * Optimisation of finite domains by using copy on write

    * Better heuristics for constraint queuing



2005-06-17  --  0.2.7
    * Added fd.InSet special constraint that tests for set inclusion

    * bumped copyright

    * pylint fixes



2004-12-22  --  0.2.6
    * Dropped support for python2.2, added support for python2.4

    * Optimized version of Expression and BinaryExpression, as well as
      several other optimizations lead to increased performance (money2 runs
      almost 40% faster with the new release, queens about 20%)

    * Optimizations in the search algorithm leads to important speedups
      when only looking for a single solution (instead of performing an
      exhaustive search of all solutions)

    * Added a warning when psyco cannot be loaded



2004-06-13  --  0.2.5
    * logilab/debian packaging

    * New constraint AllDistinct with linear narrowing time

    * updated unit tests

    * updated send+more=money example

    * added RandomizingDistributor



2002-10-16  --  0.2.3
    * New distributors SplitDistributor and EnumeratorDistributor

    * fast solution in examples/menza2.py

    * Dichotomy distributors can now split domains in more than two parts.

    * added timestamps to log messages

    * updated queens.py to use the new EnumeratorDistributor (25% speed increase)
